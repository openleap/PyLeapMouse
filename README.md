PyLeapMouse
===========

wyager's Proof-of-concept code for a Leap Motion-based mouse controller. It now works with Linux, OS X and Windows.

The most recent version is on Github at github.com/openleap/pyleapmouse.

### Installation ###
- Download the [Leap controller](https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started/) via the link in the text "`by itself`"
- Download the [SDK](https://developer.leapmotion.com/get-started/) via the green button (requires registration)
- Extract the `LeapSDK` folder from the archive

### Configuration ###
1. Launch the Leap app and plug in your Leap, if not already done
1. Configure your Leap screen from the Leap menu, if not already done
1. See [here](https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/python/devguide/Project_Setup.html) for setup instructions, in detail:
    1. `WINDOWS USERS`: You must copy the Leap.py file and all required library files (.libs and .dlls) from your Leap SDK folder to this project's `.\Windows\` folder
    1. `LINUX USERS`: You must copy the Leap.py file and all required library files (.sos) from your Leap SDK folder to the "Linux" folder (same reason as for Windows); alternatively, add the directory (or directories) containing them to your PYTHONPATH. Additionally, you must have the PyUserInput and Xlib Python modules installed
    1. `MACOS USERS`: These files are already included for OS X users, because OS X is 64-bit only
1. Run `python PyLeapMouse.py` (minus quotes) or just double-click PyLeapMouse.py if you have your computer configured to launch .py files
1. Launch with the `--palm` argument to run in palm mode (with much more accurate two-handed control).

### Usage with Finger Mode (python PyLeapMouse.py --finger) (default) ###
1. Insert your hand into frame
1. The forwardmost finger that the program detects is the mouse finger. Where it points, the cursor goes
1. Stick your thumb out (see note) to click down, and fold your thumb in to click up
1. Using two pointer fingers (e.g. index and middle) goes into scroll mode, which is not very intuitive but shows how it might work. The fingertips must be within a short distance of each other to activate scroll mode.

### Usage with Palm Mode (python PyLeapMouse.py --palm) ###
Operation is as follows:
One hand in frame: The tilt of this hand moves the mouse.
Two hands in frame: Left hand controls action.
    All fingers closed: Mouse movement with right hand tilt.
    One finger open: Clicking. Left mouse button is down. Mouse movement with right hand tilt.
    Two fingers open: Scrolling. Scrolling with right hand movement.
This is a somewhat unintuitive method of operation, but I find that it gives exceptionally better control than the most obvious "point-at-screen" method of mouse control. With this two-handed tilt based mode, it is easy to hit and properly engage small buttons, scroll through webpages, etc.

### Usage with Motion Mode (python PyLeapMouse.py --motion) ###
Movements are associated with commands listed in a file `commands.ini` placed at the root folder. Here is an example of what the file should look like :

    [screentap]

    [keytap]

    [swiperight]
    1finger: rhythmbox-client --next
    2finger: rhythmbox-client --next
    3finger: rhythmbox-client --next
    4finger: rhythmbox-client --next
    5finger: rhythmbox-client --next

    [swipeleft]
    1finger: rhythmbox-client --previous
    2finger: rhythmbox-client --previous
    3finger: rhythmbox-client --previous
    4finger: rhythmbox-client --previous
    5finger: rhythmbox-client --previous

    [clockwise]
    1finger: rhythmbox-client --play
    2finger: rhythmbox-client --play
    3finger: rhythmbox-client --play
    4finger: rhythmbox-client --play
    5finger: rhythmbox-client --play

    [counterclockwise]
    1finger: rhythmbox-client --pause
    2finger: rhythmbox-client --pause
    3finger: rhythmbox-client --pause
    4finger: rhythmbox-client --pause
    5finger: rhythmbox-client --pause

Every commands could have a different behaviour if 1, 2, 3 ... 10 fingers are recognized but it's recommended to use the same command for each number of fingers due to a lack of precision with *Leap Motion*.

### Notes ###
This is a spare-time project, so it's not perfect quality. However, I tried to keep the code clean and readable. Let me know if you find any bugs (which there are certainly at least a few of).
The contents of the files are as follows:
PyLeapMouse.py: The actual program
FingerControl.py: Pointer-finger-control specific code
PalmControl.py: Palm-tilt-control specific code
Linux/OSX/Windows:
    Various OS-specific Leap library files
    Mouse.py: A set of generic commands and classes to abstract away from OS-Specific mouse commands
Geometry.py: Geometric functions
MiscFunctions.py: Things that aren't strictly geometry and aren't specific to any interface style
README.md: You are here

### Advanced Options ###
`--smooth-aggressiveness [value]` sets the number of samples to use for pointer finger mouse smoothing.
`--smooth-falloff [value]` sets the rate at which previous samples lose importance.
For every sample back in time, the previous location of the mouse is weighted with weight smooth_falloff^(-#sample).
So if smooth_falloff = 1.2, the current frame has weight 1/(1.2^0)=1, but the frame from 5 frames ago has weight 1/(1.2^5) = .4
By default, the smooth aggressiveness is 8 frames with a falloff of 1.3.

### TODO ###
Add proper relative mouse movement. Should be pretty easy on Windows, not sure how to do so on OS X.
Add multiple monitor support for absolute mouse mode (and OS X's pseudo-relative mode).
Use PyUserInput for all mouse input? Or use Xlib directly for Linux?
